                <p>Jessica’s had the nightmares for as long as she can remember. Nightmares of being judged for people who have died, of being branded by the angels. Her friends and family think she’s crazy because of it all. Yet she carries the mark of the condemned, seared into the back of her neck, and hides it and herself away from the world. </p>

                <p>But when two men she can’t ignore enter her life, everything changes, including the nightmares. The two of them couldn’t be more different. She will do anything to be with one of them. Even tell him the truth about angels, why she never sleeps, and the scar on the back of her neck. But one of the two has set events into motion what will pull her toward her own judgment and turn her into the object of her greatest fear.</p>

                <h2>Editorial Reviews</h2>
                <blockquote>"This is one impressive book.  The storyline of this book is unlike anything else that I have ever read.  Taylor creates a unique and terrifying image of angels that will intrigue all readers.  This is definitely a must read for paranormal romance lovers."
                    - Jackie (The Book Whisperer blog)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"Branded was a thrilling and unique novel. The refreshing quality in the storyline surpassed any angel stereotype I've read so far.  Keary is an indie author who has the ability to move her readers.  I truly cannot wait to see what Keary has in store for us next!"
                    - Elenie (La Femme Readers blog)
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>"Taylor has presented a fresh idea with a delightfully independent and strong female protagonist that will keep you cheering for her throughout the story.  Branded is, in a nutshell, a rich blend of biblical undertones, the weight of right and wrong, and the quest to save one's soul."

                <h2>Amazon Reviews</h2>
                <blockquote>I really enjoyed everything in this book except the way it ended. I couldn't put this book down once I started it, I just wish that the ending had a better explanation. It is a very haunting story. I love the premise of the book and I loved the character, Jessica. How terrible it must be to stand trial for people who have died and be tormented with by their pain and suffering.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>The idea was very creative for this book. I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was well written. The characters behaviors are believable. I appreciate that the book was clean.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>I loved the idea of this story and how the main character, Jessica, stood trial in front of the angels every time she slept. She is only human, so sleep is inevitable. I have read a few series containing supernatural characters such as angels, but this particular book was different in that the angels were terrifying and had everything to do with Jessica's never ending torture, whether the angels be the Condemned (evil) or the Exalted (good). The author is a great writer, but I wish that she had used more words--for example, the word "chuckle" was used far too many times in her dialogue tags; every character seemed to be chuckling. I was surprised that the editor never caught on to the author's overuse of certain words. Although the story was great, I found myself rushing through some unnecessary chapters of her constant torment to find out the predictable ending. I could not relate to ANY of the characters in this book. I pitied the main character, Jessica, because she was always in pain and suffering through each and every day; it was a little too repetitive. The love story was rushed, and I really didn't understand how Alex and Jessica loved each other so fiercely. I knew who what Cole was from the beginning, and Jessica's shifting and conflicting feelings towards him was confusing as well. I just feel that there wasn't enough character development--maybe there will be in the next books, but I honestly don't know if I want to read them. I was going to give it 2 stars, but I gave it 3 because it kept me engaged and wanting to know the reason behind the dreams and her torment. I loved the dream sequences, and I wish that the author had spent more time with them.</blockquote>
