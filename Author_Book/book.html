                <p>Jessica’s had the nightmares for as long as she can remember. Nightmares of being judged for people who have died, of being branded by the angels. Her friends and family think she’s crazy because of it all. Yet she carries the mark of the condemned, seared into the back of her neck, and hides it and herself away from the world. </p>

                <p>But when two men she can’t ignore enter her life, everything changes, including the nightmares. The two of them couldn’t be more different. She will do anything to be with one of them. Even tell him the truth about angels, why she never sleeps, and the scar on the back of her neck. But one of the two has set events into motion what will pull her toward her own judgment and turn her into the object of her greatest fear.</p>

                        <blockquote>Taylor has presented a fresh idea with a delightfully independent and strong female protagonist that will keep you cheering for her throughout the story.  Branded is, in a nutshell, a rich blend of biblical undertones, the weight of right and wrong, and the quest to save one's soul.

                        <blockquote>Branded was a thrilling and unique novel. The refreshing quality in the storyline surpassed any angel stereotype I've read so far.  Keary is an indie author who has the ability to move her readers.  I truly cannot wait to see what Keary has in store for us next!

                        <blockquote>I enjoyed this book except the way it ended. I couldn't put this book down once I started it, I just wish that the ending had a better explanation. I loved the character, Jessica. How terrible it must be to stand trial for people who have died and be tormented with by their pain and suffering.
