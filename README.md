This webpage features the Yellowstone National Park. All information and images are taken from the offical site. Bootstrap was used in this for the social icons. This also makes this site good for smaller screens, but not really mobile responsive.

I used the HP Spectre for the product. I kept the same color scheme for the webpage. All of the content of this page comes from hp. This site takes the information from HP and images from the web to bring a nice look for this product. I wanted to see if I can duplicate the HP Spectre page and make changes to it.
